# Outline: Adapting SDN Financial Exchange Project for Algorithmic Stock Trading Competition

This outline describes the steps and components needed to transform the SDN multicast simulation into a demo platform for an algorithmic stock trading competition.

---

## 1. Core Components

### 1.1 Exchange Simulation (Already Implemented)
- SDN-based financial exchange network (Mininet, Ryu controllers)
- Multicast market data dissemination (CloudEx/Jasper/DBO)

### 1.2 New Components for Competition
- **Order Entry API**: REST or TCP server for bots to submit orders (buy/sell)
- **Order Matching Engine**: Central order book to match orders, generate trades
- **Bot Integration SDK**: Simple Python client for participants to connect and trade
- **Competition Logic**: Scoring, P&L tracking, leaderboard
- **Live Visualization (Optional)**: Real-time stats, trades, rankings

## 2. Directory Structure (Proposed Additions)

```
COMPETITION_OUTLINE.md
exchange/
  order_book.py           # Matching engine logic
  api_server.py           # REST/TCP API for order entry
bots/
  sample_bot.py           # Example trading bot/client
  bot_interface.py        # SDK for participants
competition/
  scoring.py              # P&L, ranking logic
  leaderboard.py          # Web or CLI leaderboard
visualization/
  dashboard.py            # (Optional) Real-time web dashboard
```

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Design Order Entry API**
    - Choose REST (Flask/FastAPI) or TCP socket protocol
    - Define endpoints/messages for order submission, status, market data subscription
2. **Implement Order Book & Matching Engine**
    - Centralized order matching (limit/market orders)
    - Trade event generation, order status updates
3. **Bot SDK & Sample Bot**
    - Provide a Python client to connect, receive market data, and submit orders
    - Document API usage and provide a template
4. **Competition Logic**
    - Track P&L, enforce risk limits if needed
    - Periodically update and broadcast leaderboard
5. **Visualization (Optional)**
    - Live dashboard for trades, market data, and rankings
6. **Integrate with Existing SDN Simulation**
    - Ensure market data flows through multicast (as now)
    - Orders/trades flow through the new API
7. **Update Docker/Compose**
    - Add services for API server, bots, and dashboard
    - Document orchestration for demo/competition

---

## 4. Example Workflow

1. Start the SDN simulation (Mininet + Ryu controller)
2. Launch the order entry API and matching engine
3. Participants run their bots (locally or in Docker)
4. Bots receive market data via multicast, submit orders via API
5. Trades are matched, P&L and leaderboard are updated
6. (Optional) Dashboard displays live competition status

## 5. Next Steps
- Review this outline with stakeholders
- Decide on API protocol and visualization scope
- Begin implementation in the proposed subdirectories
- Update documentation and Compose file as components are added

*This outline provides a modular roadmap for evolving the SDN financial exchange simulation into a full-featured algorithmic trading competition platform.*

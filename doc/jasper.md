# Jasper: Fair and Efficient Multicast in Financial Networks

Jasper is a multicast optimization algorithm designed for financial exchanges, focusing on fairness and low-latency delivery of market data to a large number of receivers. It constructs a multicast tree that balances delivery times, introducing controlled delays when necessary to ensure all participants receive updates nearly simultaneously. Jasper's approach is highly scalable and achieves sub-millisecond fairness, making it suitable for demanding electronic trading environments.

**Key Features:**
- Fair delivery: Minimizes delivery time differences between receivers.
- Scalability: Supports thousands of receivers with efficient resource use.
- Practical for cloud and SDN deployments.

Jasper outperforms basic multicast and other approaches in both fairness and latency, as demonstrated in recent research and simulations.

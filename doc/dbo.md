# DBO Algorithm: Executive Brief

DBO (Delivery-Clock-Based Ordering) is a multicast algorithm that achieves perfect fairness and ultra-low latency without requiring clock synchronization across the network. Instead, it uses a delivery-clock mechanism to coordinate message delivery, ensuring all receivers process updates in a tightly controlled order. DBO is especially effective in environments with unpredictable network delays, such as financial exchanges, and offers practical advantages over clock-synchronization-based solutions.

**Key Features:**
- Perfect fairness: All receivers process messages in the same order with minimal delay.
- No need for clock sync: Operates without external time synchronization.
- Robust to network jitter and variable delays.

DBO is well-suited for high-frequency trading and distributed systems where fairness and determinism are critical.

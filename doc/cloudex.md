# CloudEx: A Fair-Access Financial Exchange in the Cloud

CloudEx is a multicast algorithm designed for fairness and low latency in financial networks, leveraging clock synchronization and dynamic message delay tuning. By coordinating the timing of message delivery across all receivers, CloudEx ensures that market data is distributed both quickly and fairly, even in geographically distributed or cloud-based environments. Its adaptive approach allows it to maintain high performance under varying network conditions.

**Key Features:**
- Uses clock synchronization to coordinate delivery.
- Dynamically tunes message delays for optimal fairness.
- Proven to achieve low latency and high fairness in real-world deployments.

CloudEx is a leading solution for fair and efficient multicast in modern, distributed financial exchange infrastructures.
